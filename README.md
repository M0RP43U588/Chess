# I use Arch btw
This is a school project we worked on in IMS.

Ours is the only project in the entire class that doesn't focus on gambling.

For some reason, we are required to implement the project in Java, even though it uses more than 100 times as much memory as C and over 10 times as much as Python.

However, my friend and I decided to develop a chess game (maybe). We don’t think it’s too complex (well, maybe it is...), but it should be impressive enough to stand out and earn us a good grade.

We did not finish it because it was too complex and we did not have enough time.
